->uses random coefficient models
->Takes points scored by a driver,team ,team-year
->Also takes into account the varying of the attributes by year,Track type,weather condition
->sees how teams and drivers have changed over the years
->race result can be nested within a driver, a team-year, and a team.
->complex Multilevel model.



Multilevel logistic regression-
Multilevel logistic regression models allow one to account for the clustering of subjects within clusters of higher‐level units when estimating the effect of subject and cluster characteristics on subject outcomes.




What we want to do different-
->the paper tries to compare all drivers from the year 1971 to current which is not a fair comparison-
    - Some drivers could have outperformed themselves due to amazing rivalry (Prost Senna) 
      and if there would have been other drivers maybe it wouldnt be the same
    - Some drivers could just be more comfortable in a particular car and would have not achieved what they did if they had a slightly different car.
      and as the car level can be taken into account but car comfort cannot
    - The cars have also changed a huge amount with every new set of rules that comes out every decade and completely changes the sport.
->It would be better if the predictions could be done decade wise(or some time period wise when there was a massive change in the car)
    this would also solve the problem of different generation and rivalry coming into picture.
->We also suggest that predictions be made according to weather and circuits saying who is the best driver for the job.
    be it driving in the rain or on a particular circuit as these predictions will have more meaning.
->Taking all races and all seasons of a driver would also mean reducing the value of few important events like when the driver would have completely outperformed himself under pressure
  or the opposite where he would have completely destroyed an easy race.
  and these are the factors that should have more meaning than just simple race finishes where the driver just did his normal job.
  so taking everything together would smooth it all out which is not good.
->Taking separate timelines and circuits and conditions would add more weight to these races and give a more accurate representation of the driver.

->Eichenberger and Stadelmann (2009) consider finishing position as the dependent variable, control for team-years using dummy variables 
in a standard OLS-estimated single-level regression, and 
also control for a range of other variables relating to both drivers and the racing conditions

->Phillips argues that this unexpected result is caused by the use of finishing position as the dependent variable, and prefers the use of (adjusted) points scored as an appropriate measure,
 since he argues this is a better measure of achievement in F1;
->rankings are based on drivers’ 3-year (or 5-year) peak performance (rather than their whole career).
